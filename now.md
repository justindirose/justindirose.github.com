title: Current Main Areas of Focus

It's so easy for me to lose focus. I like to say yes. But Derek Sivers had a great idea: write down what your focus is and post it on your website.

1. **Family** - My wife and I have our first baby on the way, so my top priority is learning how to be the best dad and husband I can be. It's one of my highest callings in life.
2. **Worship** - The Lord has been opening more doors in this area of my life. I am focusing on learning to lead myself and others deeper into the presence of God on an individual, local, and regional level.
3. **Empowerment** - I want to see others empowered to be the fullest selves they can be, so I'm focusing on empowering others by taking what I know and have and packaging it for them. I am doing this mostly by writing my blog and speaking.
4. **Health** - I see a greater and greater need to keep myself healthy for the future, so I am investing in staying active and eating well.
