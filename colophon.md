I like to write these things since I'm a geek.

This site is powered by [Jekyll][1] and [GitHub Pages][2]. I love this setup because it's geeky, fast, and free.

I designed and developed the theme of this site. You can take a look at the source on [GitHub][source].

### Ads

While reader sponsorship may be an option in the future, I promise you will not see ads on this site. I don't believe in selling your attention to make some money.

### Gear

* [Mid-2011 11" Macbook Air][3] + [Dell P-Series 22" Monitor][4] hooked up via [Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort][5]
* [Logitech K350 + M510 Wireless Keyboard & Mouse][6]
* [iPad Mini 1][7] with a [cheap keyboard case][8]
* [iPhone 6 Plus][9] with iOS 9
* [IKEA Bekant Sit/Stand Desk][10]
* Hands, Eyes, and a Brain

### Software

* [Atom][11] (Mac) - My dev environment of choice
* [nvALT][12] (Mac) - Where I draft posts on my Mac
* [Dropbox][13] (Mac & iOS) - Syncable storage I've loved and used for years
* [OminFocus][14] (Mac & iOS) - Task management software to keep me on track
* [Drafts][15] (iOS) - If I can capture it in text on the go, it usually starts in this app
