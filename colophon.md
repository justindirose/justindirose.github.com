This site is powered by [Jekyll][1] and [GitHub Pages][2]. I love this setup because it's geeky, fast, and free.

I designed and developed the theme of this site. You can take a look at the source on [GitHub][source].

### Gear

* [Mid-2011 11" Macbook Air][3] + [Dell P-Series 22" Monitor][4] hooked up via [Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort][5]
* [Logitech K350 + M510 Wireless Keyboard & Mouse][6]
* [iPad Air 2][7] with a [Microsoft Universal Keyboard][8]
* [iPhone 6 Plus][9] with iOS 10

### Software

* [Sublime Text][11] (Mac) - My dev environment of choice
* [Byword][12] (Mac) - Where I draft posts
* [Dropbox][13] (Mac & iOS) - Syncable storage I've loved and used for years
* [OminFocus][14] (Mac & iOS) - Task management software to keep me on track
* [Drafts][15] (iOS) - If I can capture it in text on the go, it usually starts in this app
