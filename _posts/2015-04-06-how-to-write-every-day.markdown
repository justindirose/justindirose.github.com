title: How to Write Every Day
---

Have you tried to form a daily writing habit? Were you able to find yourself disciplined enough to keep going as long as you wanted, or did your motivation wane after a few weeks?





Writing is hard as it is, but writing every day is harder.





For the last three months, I've been writing daily first thing in the morning. But that has not been without challenges. Sometimes I wake up too late, other times I feel completely blocked up inside, not knowing what or how to write. I've been fatigued, discouraged, and unsure if I want to continue writing.





Some of these challenges have likely been holding you back from writing every day. Don't worry. They're just challenges. What's more important to know is **you are capable of overcoming any challenge to write every day.**





Every good thing which grows you is painful or challenging to some degree. You're re-training yourself to live and think differently. That's okay. You don't have to shy away from it. Though challenges are straining and tough, there's something incredible on the other side of the difficult, a reward you can reap.





Even so far, writing every day has helped me:







  1. develop my personal voice,


  2. learn to process and structure my thoughts more articulately,


  3. and grow my personal character by keeping a committment to myself and others by writing every day.





That's simply after three months. Can you imagine the growth you'd have after years?





The growth and progress make the struggle worth fighting to write every day.





### Overcoming the Challenge of Writing Every Day





There's nothing that will beat the challenge of writing every day for you, no tip, trick, or article which will come to the rescue. However, there are some things you can do to help alleviate the pressure of creating a new habit. I've found the below list to be helpful for me.







  1. **Commit to yourself to show up every day, no matter what.** Don't worry about word count. Whether you get 30 or 3,000 words on the page isn't a big deal, nor is if it's at the exact same time every day. What matters is showing up and actually writing.


  2. **Think out ahead and find your long-term goals for writing.** Ask yourself, "Why am I wanting to write every day? To journal? Do I want to build up to writing a book? Am I writing a weekly blog? A newsletter? Songs?" Defining your long-term goals will help keep you focused and ready to overcome any obstacles.


  3. **Believe you can make the time to write each day.** With our ever-increasingly busy lives, it's all too easy to believe you have "no time" for writing, or anything extra for that matter. That's a big lie. Honestly, you have the time. There are 24 hours each day; you can choose to use any of that time to make writing a priority.


  4. **Set aside time you've made to write, even if it's only 10 minutes.** If you need to, put it on the calendar. When it's time, start writing.


  5. **Find tools that work for you enabling you to write wherever you are.** Remove barriers to your writing and find tools which work for you. If you don't know right now, keep trying different things.





Implementing some of these tools will help you overcome some of the challenges of writing every day, but not all of them. But with your determination combined with a committment to write every day, you will find success.
