title: What do we do with public moral failure?
---

_We’re taking a break from our series on overcoming depression this week to look at yet another timely topic._





Adrian Peterson. Ray Rice. Mark Driscoll. David Yonggi Cho.





These names have in common a heartbreaking story of acts behind closed doors leading to public failure.





Many of these people we’ve looked up to, enjoyed watching on the field, or taken spiritual advice from their materials. Yet now, we’re left with a question: what do we do?





What do we do with failure?
With disgrace?
With broken trust?





How do you handle such flagrant, public failures from leaders holding high profile positions? It seems to be no easy road.





Trust is a fragile currency earned through hard work and intimacy. It's based on integrity validated by repeated demonstrations of character. What do you do when it's gone?





Do you throw out everything that person has done? Do you shove them out of influencing your life? Do you throw the proverbial baby out with the bath water?





No.





*"What?”*, you might be saying.





Failures of this caliber always cause us to question everything about a person. Can I believe what they say? Can I believe what they’ve said, the actions I’ve seen them take, the success they have?





Yet it takes intentional eyes to step back from a situation to see the real person. **Our own hurt blinds, offense deafens, and bitterness hardens, but a forgiving heart chooses to see clearly.**





We can be held back by the offense of the action, the broken trust, but forgiveness enables us to see the person for who they really are without the blinders of bitterness.





So do we have to throw a person’s life work out with their failure? No.





Do we need to evaluate their influence on our lives? Yes.
Does forgiveness make a wrong right and hurt less? No.





But forgiveness does allow us to see clearly, and help us receive the God in others when it’s not so visible.
