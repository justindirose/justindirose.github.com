title: 'Design: A Marriage of Orchestration and Procreation'

---

I recently watched a video of Tom Kelley, founder of IDEO, stating that everything in this world, save for nature, is designed by man. He was highlighting the importance of design and how influences everyday items. Tables, glasses, forks, televisions, lights, cars, computers, phones, airplanes, spaceships. All of this was designed.





We have to remember nature is designed, too. It just looks different than what we design.





Nature was designed with life in mind. God designed it as a perfect marriage of the orchestrated with the procreated, the formulaic with the organic.





Our design is merely but a shadow of His ultimate design in the universe. God's creation is the perfection of form and function. Just as earthly designers create to have functional objects with desirable form, our God has created the whole Earth to mirror Himself: lovely, functional, useful, beautiful.





It's as if the perfection of design requires form and function, structure and relationship, to be held within perfect tension. If function is out of balance, it will be rigid and displeasing, though useful. Conversely, if form is out of balance, it will be wonderufl to hold and behold, but frustrating to utilize.





Likewise with the orchestrated and procreated.





Life is designed to be held in the balance. It was created to hold a tension between two extremes. Life can't be without tension. Therefore our creations can't be either!





You, being a designer, creative, longing to see something new in the world, are meant to be held in tension. You are meant to create from this place. To see what is not yet and make it now. The process in between is what is beautiful, and it's giving you the function needed to get to the end result.





I suppose we might want to treat life more like design. A little bit of the procreated, some of the orchestrated. A balance that will keep us centered upon who we are and launch us forth into the future of ourselves with God.
