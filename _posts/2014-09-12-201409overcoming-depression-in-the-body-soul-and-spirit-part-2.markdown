The human body is an incredible wonder. It’s intricacies are still as unknown and not understood as the deep seas and furthest reaches of space. I find it incredible we’ve had the ability to narrow down possible physical causes of depression in our limited understanding of the miracle of human life.





Depression, though it often has its roots in the soul and spirit (which we will address in the coming weeks), can have major implications in the body. Some of it’s physical symptoms can include [indigestion, difficulty breathing, tightness in the chest, and general fatigue](http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2014/08/12/five-common-myths-about-depression/). Depression slows you down, often causes you to lose or gain weight (as it did for me), and, ultimately, opens the possibility to put yourself in a dire situation from the sum of your choices to keep your body healthy or not.





Though I believe it’s important to deal with the root soul and spirit causes of depression, in my journey in overcoming it, I discovered keeping the body is just as important to getting and staying healthy and free.
What did I learn that has helped me get on the other side of depression?





### 1. Eat Well





Since I started dating my wife, she’s helped me get a perspective on what it takes to eat healthily. Prior to that, I’d eat whatever was in front of me, often turning to fast food or cheap, processed foods high in carbs. There were many times I’d make a frozen pizza only to sit down and eat the whole thing. That was 1,200 calories a pizza! I’d feel bad about eating it, but the insane amount of calories I’d eat along with the high fats and carbs would cause me to feel down. I gained weight and continued having poor self image.





Now, my diet consists of a lot of vegetables, foods high in protein, and not nearly as many carbs. It’s all about changing your mindset, and it took me a long time to start eating right. The journey was step by step, starting with eating fruits at work for a snack instead of candy, and slowly progressed from there. Now I crave healthy foods, my mind is clearer, and I don’t walk around in carbo-fog all day. Diet affects the chemistry of your body, so it’s important to make sure you take in the nutrients you need! Not having them, in my experience, contributes to depression.





### 2. Exercise





I’ll be honest, this area is one I still struggle with building good habits. Stress can often be a factor in depression, and one of the best ways I’ve found to deal with stress is exercising with a purpose. Sometimes after work I’ll go to the back yard and chop wood. Maybe I’ll go for a run or a bike ride. Other times I’ll just mow the lawn. What’s important is giving your body what it needs. I’ve heard it said mental exhaustion requires physical exertion to rest. You rest by doing the opposite of how you are drained.





So if you work a mind-exhausting day job, go do something active after work instead of watching TV or continuing to do mentally draining work after work!





I’ve been finding some practical ways I’ve been learning to build momentum in this area. Here are some ideas I’ve come up with:
* Go for a walk at lunch
* Switch from a sitting desk (which is [really bad for your health](http://www.mattmcwilliams.com/7-symptoms-sitting-too-much/)) to a standing one

* Get a sporting hobby with your spouse or a friend like riding bike together
* Use the [7-Minute Workout](https://7minuteworkout.jnj.com/) app for a quick workout during the day
* Remember to rest your brain in the middle of the day by being active





### 3. See a Doctor





Wait what? Yeah. I said it. See a doctor.





Sometimes Christians can get hung up on waiting for the Lord to break through when sometimes He wants us to use the resources available to us as well. God didn’t condemn medicine; He gave mankind the wisdom to decipher the chemical code of nature so we could apply it for all kinds of purposes. Medicine is one of them. He also gave us wisdom to understand the human body. Every good gift is from Him, including our understanding of medicine.
Therefore, medicine is not a second class healing. Though I believe God moves in miracles, as He did in my life, there is nothing wrong with going to the doctor to seek help. They can help apply their understanding of the human body to your life and help you process through what’s going on in you to determine what can assist you.





I went to the doctor when I was feeling depressed. He gave me antidepressants. Though others have had good experiences, this didn't work out so well for me. The drugs made me feel only one emotion: anger. I felt flat otherwise. It was not fun, life was not enjoyable. I couldn't feel. So I got off of them and continued my journey to healing.





The experience may be different for you. I still recommend to see a doctor, but we have to remember there are other underlying causes of depression that don't exist in the body, but are in the soul and even the spirit. Addressing the symptom doesn't mean you're resolving the problem. My problems and areas of unresolved pain in my life started in the soul and spirit, and, thus, needed to be resolved there.





### The Long and Short of It All…





What we do with and put into our bodies affects the other facets of our being. If you take one thing away from this article, it is this: be mindful of what you do with your body. Make efforts to change bad habits into better ones. And don't be afraid to involve other people in your journey through.





You're not alone. Ever.
