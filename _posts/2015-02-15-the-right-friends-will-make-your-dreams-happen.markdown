title: The Right Friends Will Make Your Dreams Happen

---






Our lives are the sum of our influences, those people who lead and guide us, who we look up to, who let us walk the path of life with them. I'm only 27, and, looking back on life, it's absolutely amazing how I see the impact of my parents, teachers, coaches, and mentors on me.





I may not have had a choice who influenced me when I was growing up. I didn't choose my family, nor did I have much say on where I was going to live.





Yet, as I mature, I've learned I have the power to intentionally filter who and what will influence me. I can choose my friends, church, college, workplace, favorite music, and locale.





I'm free to be influenced by _whatever I want_. And so are you.





**With this freedom comes responsibility to manage it.**





We manage our freedom by defining the vision for our life and intentionally selecting our influences to match those goals. This selectivity applies to the books we read and movies we watch, all the way down to the friends we have and the person we choose to marry.





Who will you let influence you? Surround yourself with those you want to be like. As you do, you will naturally grow in the direction of your dreams. So to say, **the right friends will make your dreams happen**.
