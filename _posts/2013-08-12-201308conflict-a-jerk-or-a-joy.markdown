title: 'Conflict: a Jerk or a Joy'
---

Before I married my wife, I had a roommate for a few years. He's one of the closest friends I have. But it didn't always used to be that way. We had about six months of intense conflict while we were living together. We got some inner healing individually, pushed through, and that resulted in the friendship. We made it through conflict successfully.
Conflict is a jerk whom I used to hate. Seriously. It comes to threaten, destroy, and kill every relationship.




Or does it?




I think it's a matter of perspective.




Conflict can be the all-destructive force we must hold peace talks to avoid. Or it can be a sign you're getting intimate enough to have authentic relationship.




Conflict is something every community must go through to get to the next level of relationship. Communities start at the _honeymoon_ stage. Much like a married couple on their first voyage together, the honeymoon-stage community is just getting to know each other in an intimate group setting. Then, after the newness wears off, walls come down. People get comfortable. Opinions fly back and forth. And guess whatâ€¦ people bash heads. Often HARD.




I know the temptation to shy away from this stage exists, and it's very easy to do. It's as easy as walking away from relationships, leaving a church, or controlling and badgering the crap out of those you're leading. What it comes down to is this, though: the conflict stage is the most important stage of relationship. It will test you deeply. It will prove to you that you either value relationship with the person or value being in agreement, and it will make or break your community.




Leaders and creatives need community. Our best solutions and ideas don't come from ourselves sitting in a closet or bedroom tinkering away with our thoughts. They come from the collaboration of community. Yet many leaders and creatives still gravitate toward the isolation of "freedom from conflict."




Maybe we've developed such an isolationist culture because we dislike hardship. I know our grandparents and great-grandparents faced one of the hardest times in our history as a country: The Great Depression. They saved bread bags and gathered scrap metal and useful plants for our military just so we could make it through the hard times. They worked hard and pushed through into one of the most plentiful seasons. But some pendulum must've swung the other way away from this place of conflict into the land of the cushy-cushy.




Life isn't cushy-cushy.




We take risks and find ourselves in places where we feel overwhelmed, in over our head, and terrified. Heck, if you're leading something going _anywhere_, you probably feel this at least once a week. It's a tense place.




It's a good thing conflict is just a sign of tension. Tension will launch us into our destinies if we let it. So if we embrace conflict and tension, and dig deeply into relationship, we will find a well-spring of life at the bottom of the hole.




Maybe what you need to succeed is at the bottom of that hole.




Maybe something necessary for life exists at the bottom of conflict.




Maybe your best friend exists on the other side of an incredibly intense fight with someone you care for.




Maybe your destiny lies with the people you've run away from.




Just maybe there's something more for you in this.




So what are you waiting for?




Dig deep.
