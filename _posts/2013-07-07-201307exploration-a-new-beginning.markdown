Life is lived in tension empowered by one of two things: fear or love. Fear keeps us out of alignment and out of tension, but love holds it all together, like a rubber band waiting to be launched. What I'm doing right now is a step from fear to love. I'm overcoming, and here's why.
I've been wrestling for months on how to put my life together and pursue not only what I'm good at, but what I'm passionate about. I've been reading books, listening to lectures and teachings, journaling, and talking to my graciously amazing wife. Yet what all the research, learning, and discussing boils down to is this: you can't steer a parked car. (I know, an adage, a cliche. I'm full of them. Deal with it.) I've discovered that I have to take the first step toward the goal to get there. You don't get 100% of the things you don't ask for, nor do you achieve 100% of the goals you don't go after. So this is me asking and going after something. I am pushing past every lie of fear in my body and soul and saying, "NO!" I'm going to start writing this blog and finding my voice.




My goal with this blog is to explore ideas and empower people. My heart's cry is worship to God, but my desire is to see heaven's solutions invade earth's problems. I want to see Jesus' name lifted high at the top of every mountain and His presence ending up the center of every soul, to see all people empowered in their identity as creative people, to see problems eradicated with heaven's solutions, and to see anyone interested in pursuing their passions and dreams equipped with the tools and resources to go after them. In no way do I have all the answers, but I know the Guy Who Does.




Tension brought me to a crossroad. Do I live a boring life, doing only what I _should_ do? Or do I seek to live a life abundantly? We always have a choice. I've made mine. This part of the journey starts today.
