title: Living Proactively by Priorities
---

The phone is ringing. You receive an email notification. A coworker steps into your cube to ask a question. And you have a project to work on due three days ago.





Sounds like a normal day at the office.





These are the days of constant interruptions, the "always urgent" tasks from someone else, the near incessant noise of demands for attention. Somedays, it can be difficult to get real work done.





Regardless of where you're working or how interruptions come, it's hard to get what's really important done. **When everything is vying for your attention, it's hard to live on your priorities unless they're clearly defined.**





Living on anything but your priorities is what I call a _reactive mindset_.





Some like living this way. Sure, it's easy and requires little thinking, but it's stressful and unsatisfying. For me, it gets old. I get tired, cranky, and lose sight of my purpose in doing the work I am. In a reactive mindset, I ultimately find myself bored.





When you live reactively you lose a few things:







  * A sense of self


  * A sense of purpose


  * A sense of emotional well-being





These not only affect you, but others as well, including your spouse, family, friends, customers, and fellow employees.





Why? Because you lost the very reason why you do what you do. Nobody is impacted very much by person aimlessly wandering through life at the whim of someone else's command.





There's a great Bible verse that says, "Without a vision, the people perish." Some translations state, "Without a vision, the people go unrestrained."





In essence, the writer is trying to say having vision is the key to being effective in life. Instead of running around without a sense of purpose and priority, we're meant to discover and pursue a purpose, a higher calling, a reason to exist and focus.





If purpose is the sense of a higher calling, a reason you're here, then vision is the ability to see how that purpose is walked out. Vision keeps you "restrained" in the sense that when the phone rings, a coworker stops by, or you get an email, you have a sense of the bigger picture that keeps you from dropping everything to deal with the supposedly urgent, but not important task, in front of you.





Having vision and walking it out, or what I like to call a proactive mindset, builds into long-term thinking and satisfaction in life.





So you're stuck in a reactive mode. How do you get out? I have a few ideas for you to try.







  1. **Determine your WHY** -- It's hard to have a vision you can stick to without a driving purpose behind it. Answer the question, "I do this because..." The because statement will likely be your why. If you can't determine it right away, ask a trusted friend or journal a bit about purpose and what motivates you.


  2. **Focus on WHERE** -- Five years from now, where do you see yourself? Owning a business? Climbing the corporate ranks? Having a family? Find this direction and this is what will help focus your choices to proactively build something.


  3. **Choose HOW to proceed** -- What's the first big step toward your five year dream? Write it down. Will it take a month, six months, a year to get there? It's beneficial to have your sights set out a little further ahead.


  4. **Pick WHAT to do now** -- So you have your big dreams and the first step to get there. Decide what you can do today to start. Then do it, keeping your strategy in focus.


  5. **Learn to say NO** -- What's your vision? Say YES to the things that build toward it, and say NO to the things that don't. Your time and attention is limited, so use it wisely. Changing the world requires doing what's important over only what's urgent in the moment.





It takes time to change from a reactive mindset to a positive one. What's most important is taking steps in the right direction. **You can change how you think, therefore, how you live.**
