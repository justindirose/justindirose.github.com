title: 'Overcoming Depression in the Body, Soul, and Spirit: Forgiveness'
---

_This is part four in our five part series on overcoming depression._





There isn't one person on the planet who hasn't experienced the offense of a family member, a friend, or a leader's lack of understanding. Nor are there many who haven’t experienced being manipulated and controlled by another.
Many of us have experienced abuse, harshness, or being wronged.





And it really hurts. Every time.





Many times we leave it at, “They hurt me.” What happens then?





A seed gets planted, and it grows, and grows, and grows, until its ugly fruit is in full bloom for the whole world to see. What is the fruit of retaining offense? Bitterness.
The root of bitterness goes deep into the soul, opening us up to a wide array of spiritual assaults and emotions, and, frankly, can easily put a person in a state of rage or depression. Holding offense can even [hurt your body.](http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/08/17/bitter.resentful.ep/) It's no surprise, therefore, bitterness can produce depression.





What is often unrealized in the face of offense is a choice: the choice to **forgive.**





Forgiveness is not an easy choice to make. It's very hard, if not completely impossible, on our own. It is only the very grace and mercy of our loving God which empowers us to forgive. By His grace, His blood is applied to cover every hurt and pain to free us from judgment.





Us from judgement? Yes.





Holding offense is a form of judgment. It’s the desire to see the offense punished and justice served. What we don’t realize is in God’s upside-down Kingdom, we’re the ones going to prison when we don't forgive.





I won’t get into it all here, but [Matthew 18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+18&version=NIV) records a parable of a servant forgiven a debt equivalent to $2.2 million by his master, who then is thrown into prison to be tormented for holding a $90 debt above another servant’s head. The point of Jesus’ parable is this: we’re already forgiven, so when we hold offense, we’re giving up our freedom. We lock ourselves away and forget we have the keys to get out. The keys are forgiveness.





Forgiveness is a choice of the will to release someone from judgment in the heart. It's the choice to align our eyes with the eyes of God toward the person, instead of aligning with our pain and desire for retribution.





But how? How do you make that choice?





It’s quite simple. Pick your offense. Ask the Holy Spirit to come be with you and help you forgive as you pray. Say out loud, "I choose to forgive {this person} for {whatever they did}. I release them from my judgment." If it helps you to visualize it, imagine giving the person to Jesus or taking your hands off their throat.





It may take a few times of saying it to believe it but keep going. From there forward, if the pain from that offense comes up, pray that prayer again until it becomes heart reality for you. Each time is an opportunity to extend God’s mercy to the person. He first extended it to you, so why not to them?
I think it's important to note there are a few misconceptions which can keep us from maintaining a forgiving heart.







  1. **Forgiveness removes the pain.** - Not true. Forgiveness is a choice extending beyond pain, but puts our heart in a position to heal.


  2. **I have to restore trust with the person I forgive.** - Wrong. Forgiveness may be a choice, but trust is earned. Forgiveness allows opportunity for trust to be built again, if it is safe to do so, but does not automatically make everything A-OK.


  3. **Forgiveness happens once.** - Actually, forgiveness is a state of the heart needing maintenance just like our cars. If we run into an old offense, it's an opportunity to extend that forgiveness again. Having a heart of forgiveness also stops bitterness before it starts!


  4. **Forgiveness makes the wrong right**. - Not at all. Forgiveness is for you and you alone. It is not for the other person. Forgiving someone does not make their offense better; however, it does free your heart and make it better.





Punishment and judgment bring the allure of satisfaction if we would only hold on until it is fulfilled. What it neglects to tell us is judgment was satisfied at the cross of Christ. It is from this place we extend forgiveness to be free ourselves. Punishment's allure is only false power. Real power comes in love, mercy, and forgiveness. If I could implore you to explore only one of the topics we've discussed here, make it forgiveness. It will free your heart to be free from depression, bitterness, hatred, and, ultimately, torment.





It may not be the easiest choice, but it will be the best one.
