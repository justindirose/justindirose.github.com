title: Misplacing God in Leadership
---

For the last two years, I've been voraciously consuming podcast after podcast, book after book, principle after principle about one topic: leadership. I enjoy trying to answer the question, "How does one person cast vision, show people the way, and empower them to be their own amazing selves?" It brings me life.
In this pursuit, I am learning a lot about character, priorities, time management, self-discipline, passion, risk-taking, problem solving, and vision casting. Yet one thing remains misplaced.




God.




This is a public confession. I've misplaced God in my leadership.




I didn't realize it until I listened to an episode of the Jesus Culture Leadership Podcast. Banning Liebscher preached on carrying the word of the Lord. He said a few things, to which I had trouble listening. I felt distracted, and I wanted to turn off the podcast.




Then I realized I was not distracted, but rather feeling convicted.




See, Banning was speaking about how the primary responsibility of leaders is to carry the word of the Lord in their lives and live it out to give to others. It _abides_ in them because these leaders give it place to dwell and grow. He emphasized the importance by stating any leader should be able to tell you the word of the Lord for **every** area of his or her life.




Well, umm... that's something I've missed.




I've found myself floating astray, getting worn out, and not knowing exactly what to do or even how to do it. I've been exhausted. No wonder why. I was missing His word.




Since I received this "revelation bump," I've been processing this idea out. I realized the key to being successful is not _doing_ it right (e.g. goals, vision, conflict resolution, building momentum, etc.), but _being_ obedient. In other words, I do the word of the Lord because it abides in me, or, rather, I become it.




Being versus doing is an important distiction to make. Our performance driven culture can easily influence us to do more, have more, get more, live more, more, more, more, more. Yet, the abundant life of sonship says, "Be." When God speaks a word, He gives us the faith to walk it out. Our only responsiblity is to listen, receive, and respond. We don't have to do more to be successful, only be with God and receive His love.




Therefore, if the primary responsibility of a leader looks like listening to God, receiving His word and love, and responding to it _intentionally_ in every area of our lives, this is the Romans 12:1 worship Paul writes about. Vibrant displays of dance and melody are not worship in and of themselves. Worship originates from the heart of stillness and closeness to God, hearing Him. Being with God and carrying His word while loving Him and others is worship at the core.




So wait. I guess I'm saying in my ignorance of the word of the Lord as a leader, I've been a lousy worshipper as well.




Leadership is the life of an individual lived out in the love and service of others. So it makes only perfect sense that if my life is incorrectly focused, so is my leadership, and worship.




The only thing to keep me on track is the word of the Lord abiding in my heart, producing His fruit in my life. He is my one focus.




He **is** the source of all life. Why wouldn't He be?




* * *




I've been developing a plan to find the word of the Lord for my life. As I prayed, seven areas came to mind in which I can hear the word of the Lord. I'm sharing these in hopes to help you through this process if you're in this rut, too.




The Seven "F's" of the Abiding Word -- I definitely need a different title.






  1. Faith


  2. Family


  3. Finances


  4. Future


  5. Fellowship


  6. Fruit


  7. Fatherhood




Each area can be broken down into categories individualized for your life. For example, if you don't have a spouse and kids, the Family category can be focused on your immediate family, future family, or whatever classifies as family for you.




The last three may not be as clear, but include a lot. Fellowship relates to relationships, social life, friendships, and community. Fruit deals with the fruit of your life, including your work, character, ministry, and God's power. Fatherhood isn't dealing with being a dad, but the mentor and mentee relationships we all need in life to be healthy.




My plan is to flesh these out with my wife so we can know the word of the Lord over our lives together and live from that place.




I've lived my life liking principles. So much so that I started to forget what living from the Presence in His abiding word can look like.




Truth is:




Principles are good,




But principles birthed from the abiding word of the Lord in my life are eternally better.




Take heed and be. Hear Him. Our lives depends on it.
