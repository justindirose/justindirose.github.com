title: How to Wrestle Through Chasing a Dream
---

My gut sits in knots as I type these words on my computer.
A question burning in my mind.





_How? Just exactly how do I go after this?_





I enjoy dreaming big. I have a huge list of big dreams in my journal. My problem is putting feet on them. Actually doing them. At that point I find myself terrified.





It's an honest struggle. I get scared of moving, or of the vast nature of my dreams, or that they're not going anywhere I can see. And then I get locked up... lose sight of things... don't know what to do...



Chasing dreams being tough has been a topic of note lately, with [Carlos Whittaker](http://ragamuffinsoul.com/2014/08/dreamchasing-2/) and [Tyssul Patel](http://www.folkloredesign.com/blog/2014/7/dreaming-vs-doing), commenting on this seemingly ever-present wrestle.
It seems to be the big struggle for creatives. We have a lot of dreams, desires, things we want to accomplish and see. We expand our thinking to see what is not possible.





Yet when it comes to the nitty-gritty part of doing it, we get scared.
Sometimes it takes planning out a disciplined routine to get going. Other times it takes steping one foot forward, taking the leap, and figuring out as you go.





The most important piece is: you go when the light is green.





There's an interesting conundrum that hangs up a lot of Christians in this place: God's will. I often finding myself asking, "God, is it OK for me to do this?"





Or saying, "God, please tell me what to do!"





I've been learning something about God's heart lately, and it's that He wants us to be able to make the choice on our own, so much that He freely lets us set ourselves to pursue ideas. Then, if He doesn't think it's a great choice, He'll speak, or He'll confirm it's a good one!





As [Eric Johnson](https://twitter.com/ericbj) of [Bethel Church](http://www.ibethel.org/) puts it, "The light in the Kingdom is green until it's red." God says go for it until He says stop.
Yes, there is wisdom to be had in the process, but you can't apply wisdom to something you're not doing. Often the "wisdom" we find while idle is fear giving us an excuse not to pursue our dreams.





If God's for us and our dreams (if it matters to you, it matters to Him), then what's stopping us from pursuing the greater things in life!
So, for me, chasing my dreams is not going to be religious. It's going to be fun, and I'll get to make awesome things with people along the way!





Here's what I'm thinking my process will look like:







  * **Keep track**-- write my dreams down, as they keep coming up, process them with important people (like my wife)


  * **Start moving** -- if I'm not sensing a no, go! Even if it's something as small as researching my dream, I'll keep it in focus!


  * **Keep moving** -- Set a small goal in front of me, and be diligent to do it regularly. No dream is ever accomplished without diligent work!


  * **Invite God in and trust Him** -- Bring God into the plan, the process, and the work. Ask Him to speak to me and reveal strategies to accomplish my goals, and for wisdom!





It seems to be a proven model based on what other people have mentioned. Now, what are you waiting for? Go!
