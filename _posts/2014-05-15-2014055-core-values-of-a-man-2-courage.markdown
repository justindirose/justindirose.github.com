---

Lately there's been a word floating around. Courage. With it comes pictures of valiant soldiers fighting in battle, Bear Grylls doing whatever it takes to survive, Walter Mitty running to the ends of the earth, or firemen running into a burning building.
Those things take courage; however, the grandiose ideas of courage do not limit it to just the big screen or what's publicly recognized. Courage, in fact, is most often found in the everyday, the often-seemingly mundane struggle of life.
I come from a broken past, one filled with a heart full of hurt, lies, deception, pain, and bondage. The Lord began to call me forth out of this place, and my life began to change. He began speaking to my heart, giving me the courage to face the pain, grieve, and let Him heal the depths of my soul. Some steps were large, others small. Some easy, some ridiculously difficult. What that process has come down to is recognizing what it means to be scared or courageous. Truth is:







  * It's a cowardly thing to make a mess in your hurt; it's a courageous thing to clean it up.


  * It's a cowardly thing to run from pain; it's a courageous thing to seek healing.





Thought I'm further along in the healing process, I'm still wrong sometimes. I still fail, have a hard time, let anger or depression get the best of me. But the courage to own my stuff and make it right still grows deeper inside me. I desire to live as a man of conviction, and it takes courage to live convicted. In fact, the lives of those around me depend on me knowing who I am and my ability to stand courageous.
That's an awful big burden, Justin, you might be saying to yourself. I must say, however, whether I am doing it intentionally or not, I am teaching the world around me how to live through how I act.
Recently, I overheard a conversation in a coffee shop where an older man was exhorting a young man to love his wife. Apparently the young man was struggling with being selfish, and the elder called him forth, saying, "You have a choice to love your wife or love yourself."
We're constantly teaching the world around us what we think it's worth. From saying please and thank you to the cashier at the grocery store to how we treat our spouse at home alone, how we respond teaches others we either think they are piles of crap or uniquely amazing individuals.
It takes amazing courage to call out the positive in someone. It's selfless. Anyone can tear another down; but it takes someone courageous enough to look past the dirt to find the gold in someone and reveal it to them. Who knows, it may even be the catalyst which brings healing to them.
Grandiose displays of courage most definitely inspire me. Who wouldn't be inspired by someone overcoming the odds to break new ground? Yet the questions remains if we will be courageous in the day-to-day, being willing to hear God's heart and lay hold of His truth for our lives. Because, in reality, true courage is not purely action; it is action birthed from God speaking to the heart.
