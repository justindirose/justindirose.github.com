title: Enjoy the Swing and Cherish the Journey
---


My wife bought me this coffee cup while we were dating. It says, "Cherish the journey." It even has a little blue footprint at the bottom of the cup, as if to remind me that each step on the path is just as important as the last one. I drink my coffee from it as often as I can. It's special.

Cherishing the journey has been an incredible challenge in my life. Almost daily I battle with fearful thoughts and feelings, sometimes without even knowing it, wondering if I'm good enough or able to pursue my dreams. Of course, I **know** I am, but challenging ingrained mindsets can be difficult. It takes a deep revelation of truth, love, and connecting with who God made you to be to get there.

Recently, I discovered a piece of how to cherish my journey. I was preparing for a golf outing with a friend. Since I hadn't golfed in a few years, I started by hitting foam golf balls around my yard. I was trying to remember all the mechanics of a great swing, and even came up with a four step plan to remind myself of them as I'm swinging.

  1. Eye on the ball
  2. Keep a loose grip
  3. Don't muscle the swing
  4. Follow through

It was the perfect plan, I thought. I imagined hitting the ball perfectly every time, crushing those foam balls over the roof of my house. Yeah. It was good.

In practice, it was a disaster. I duffed, chunked, and chopped every shot I took with this AMAZING plan of mine!

I found myself incredibly frustrated. I was thinking about what I was doing too much, ruining the experience.

Then, the subtle voice of the Lord suggested, "What if you play to your strengths?"

This got me to thinking, as I know I primarily feel as a means of processing and engaging with the world around me. So, I told myself, "Feel the swing," which slowly became, "Enjoy the swing."

As I cracked at the tiny foam golf balls, I found myself laughing and enjoying my time as I was hitting them on the roof and letting them bounce down. I was hitting great shots and loved every minute of it. I was ready to hit the links.

On the course the next day, I reminded myself to enjoy the swing. Golf is all about a journey, and every swing adds to that journey. Some are great shots and others not. Despite telling myself to enjoy the process, I found myself hitting a lot of bad shots and getting _incredibly_ frustrated. I even told my golf buddy that I must have a lot of undealt-with self-hatred and performance mindsets.

Simply put, I have work to do yet. Even in the midst of frustration, I kept reminding myself, "Enjoy the swing." I think overcoming a "perfect performance" mindset takes just that: persistence. We renew our minds so we can see more of God and become like Him. He's not worried about performance; instead, He loves everything we do, no matter what level of quality it may be. He enjoys every swing and cherishes every journey, so much so because He created them, and He created us for them.

That's probably why our lives are to be a living sacrifice of praise. He sees everything we do as worship, but sometimes we get lost in the need for perfection. We're already perfect in His eyes. So we have nothing to worry about.

Because of that, I'll keep working at changing my mind. Eventually, it will change with a worshiper's level of persistence and intentionality. I'll learn to cherish the journey better than I ever have before because that is who my God says He is.

How have you learned to cherish the journey? Are you struggling to do so as well? Remember this comforting fact: though the process is never easy, the reward is everlasting.
