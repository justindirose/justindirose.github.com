There are some changes coming to justindirose.com.





I've been writing about emotional health, creativity, and purpose. I have a great passion for these topics; however, something different has been tugging at my heart.





I've always had a love for design and the web. I studied computer science in college and worked for my college’s web office for a couple of years. I enjoyed it. I even had a job offer on the table to work for a web firm rising to success in the region.





**I turned it down.**





Sometimes life takes you on a wild path. Sometimes the Lord requires you to walk away from something for a season so he can build other things in your heart. Unknown to me at the time, that’s why I walked away from web design.





For the last five years, I've walked a road of healing, hope, and love. I met my wife, something that would never have happened had I taken the job offer I had. I found real freedom and friends. I found life and what it means to be alive.





Yet, in the process, I gave up on the dream to do web design. I wrote it off as dead and something I really couldn't do. However, the last few months have shown me this is an **absolute lie**.





The truth is I am creative. I solve problems. I help people.





**I am a designer.**





It's time to start walking a different road again. So, I'm pivoting.





Instead of blogging about emotional health, **I’m starting my own web design business**.  





It's a scary road ahead of the unknown, but I know I will regret it if I don't try it.





As a result, things will be changing around here. Here's what you can expect:







  * Blog posts will stop for the time being so I can focus my time on practicing and case studies. They will remain available as an archive once I get everything switched over.


  * #MorningEncouragement will continue on my Twitter and Facebook accounts.


  * This website will under go a rebranding to reflect my new direction.





I love writing about emotional health. In fact, my future self will likely resume writing about it. But for now, this passion is getting set aside from the public eye. I have solutions to design for web problems.





Are you excited? I sure am, and I’m looking forward to having you join me on the ride.
