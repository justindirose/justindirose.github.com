title: '#RealMenAre: Create a Safer Environment Around Yourself'

---

I hope this series about being Real Men has been impactful and helpful for you. In our final post of this series, we're going to talk about environment. The environment you carry within you is the environment you will create around you.





To change culture, we first have to start dealing with our internal culture, which we've been speaking about. From there, we then must be intentional to know how we are affecting the people around us.
Men and women do not exist as islands. We affect eachother deeply as much as we sometimes like to think we don't.





You, as a man or woman, are responsible for creating the environment around yourself. What are you going to do to be intentional?





To round out the series, here are 5 things I believe are important for men to create in their environment around women for healthy relationship to occur:







  * **Protection** - Do you stand up for people around you? Or are you lusting over a woman by desiring her sexually in your mind? Do women feel safe around you? Or do they think you're a creep/rageaholic? Creepy and lustful is just as unsafe as an angry man.


  * **Honor** - Do you encourage women with your words and actions without expecting anything in return? Or do you degrade women when they aren't around with raunchy jokes? An honoring man will always lift another up even in the face of being dishonored.


  * **Service** - Do you just want someone to "make you a sandwhich" or would you make 100,000 sandwiches for someone else without the thought of payback? Would you trample over someone else to get to your goal, or would you help them get to theirs?


  * **Humility** - Can you listen and communicate well? Or do you get defensive and afraid of hearing what other people have to say because you don't want to be wrong?


  * **Respect** - If a woman says no, do you respect it and back off? Can you set boundaries with someone else yourself and say no to them? True respect is mutual, draws the line and sticks to it.
