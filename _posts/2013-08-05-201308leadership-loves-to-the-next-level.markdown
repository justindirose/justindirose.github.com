title: Leadership Loves to the Next Level
---

I once heard a story of wise man explaining leadership to a younger man. The young man asked, "What's the most important thing you can tell me about leadership?"
The wise man replied, "Leadership is service. Whoever serves is the leader, regardless of their position."




Truth is, you can't be a leader without serving. You can manage and boss people, but you can't become a leader. It's as simple as that.




My desire is to see everyone become the best leader they can become. However, people don't often see leadership as more than a position of prowess and power. In truth, it is service, a labor of love.




The key component to any relationship is to build trust. Trust is the foundation of any level of freedom and empowerment. Trust says, "I believe in you, that you care for me, and will protect me and my values." Trust allows people to walk loved. It is a deep foundation.




Leading is impossible without trust. Just like friendship is unsustainable without trust, the leader-follower relationship disintegrates without it.




So, how do you build trust?




You care.




There is an awesome biblical principle called loving others as you love yourself that drives trust-building. A temptation as a leader is to get so focused on getting to the goal, performing well, but forgetting to love the people around who make the whole thing work. That's why you have burnout in lots of different jobs. The people see the vision, but there's no love and encouragement poured into them!




I like to think of it this way: you can lead children through love or punishment. Punishment is driven from position, meaning punishers punish to see performance. Love is driven by progress. The best leaders love people up to the next level. They "cherish the journey" and serve others along the way. They learned to "enjoy the swing" and pour into others to learn how to do the same.




What kind of leader are you? Do you punish (through negative words, withholding love & encouragement, etc.) to see performance? Or do you love to the next level? How can you become a better love-leader?
