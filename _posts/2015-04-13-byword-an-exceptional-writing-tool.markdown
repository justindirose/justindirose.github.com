As [Sean McCabe](http://seanwes.com) says, "Everything starts with writing." For the blogger like me, this statement is especially true. The starting point is writing, and the finished product is writing. So when you're writing, you want your tools to work, make it easier to write, and, essentially, stay out of the way.





That's why I like [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/).





Byword is a [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)-focused, distraction-free word processor for OS X and iOS.





Though Byword has many features making it an excellent text editor and writing tool, it became my writing app of choice for one major reason: **it handles Markdown beautifully.**





Markdown is a formatting syntax designed by [John Gruber](http://www.daringfireball.net) to make writing HTML faster. It uses asterisks, pound signs (more commonly beloved by Millenials as #hastags), and brackets to denote images, headings, bold and italic fonts, and footnotes. Markdown is beautifully simple and only requires a simple text file to use.





Byword, however, takes Markdown editing to another level. When adding Markdown, Byword automatically formats the text. You can see how text will look as you go and know if you used the Markdown syntax correctly. For example, if I surround a sentence with double asterisks (**), it will automatically bold the sentence text. If you're a Markdown beginner, text can be formatted using keyboard shortcuts or the Mac menubar, like any other text editor, until you're comfortable with the formatting.





Many use Byword for its distraction-free mode, which means when you open up Byword, all you get is a blank page. You can use the app full screen, where it shows the text you are typing and that's it. There are no toolbars, no confusing formatting, or nothing to fiddle with. In other words, the app stays out of the way. I think this is essential for a great writing tool.





Additionally, Byword offers seemless integration with cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. This feature works nicely if you want to use an iOS device to continue writing. Previously, I found the iOS client a bit clumsy and buggy to use, but recent updates have improved the app. I use the iOS version on my iPad to write on the go sometimes, but my preferred writing device of choice is the Mac.





When it comes to writing, the last thing I want to have get in the way is software. Byword provides a simple, user-friendly interface to help improve your writing experience with Markdown.





You can find Byword on the [iOS](http://bywordapp.com/ios) and [Mac](http://bywordapp.com/mas) App Stores.
