title: How Do You Change the World?
---

Do you want to change the world? I most certainly do.
Recently, I was part of an email conversation discussing how to bring positive transformation to the city in which I live. We want to see poverty removed, abuse eliminated, joy released, and love known by the peoples of this region. The suggestion was to "rebuild the walls", referencing a passage in Nehemiah. "What's our wall to rebuild?" The question caused me to ponder.




Walls are naturally for protection. They set boundary to your property and keep out intruders. Walls, like emotional boundaries, are an integral part of life. You will protect what you value naturally. However, when at a new idea or mindset, value doesn't exist until it's cultivated.




When I began thinking, I realized Nehemiah was only a small part of the picture in rebuilding the city of Jerusalem after the exile of the Jews to Babylon. There were many others involved in the process. But it all starts with Daniel.




Daniel was taken captive with the Jews to Babylon as a boy. Being of royal heritage, he was brought into service of the king of Babylon and served there his whole life. He encountered immense persecution and tribulation, but Daniel was a man of steadfast character and integrity. Even in the midst of mandated idolatry, Daniel still worshipped God. He handled persecution with strength and honor. Daniel was an righteous man.




In his uprightness and nobility, Daniel became an influencer of Nebuchadnezzar. Upon hving a troubling dream, Nebuchadnezzar called upon Daniel for interpretation. This is what happened.





>  [Daniel] answered, “My lord, if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries! 20 The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, with its top touching the sky, visible to the whole earth, 21 with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit, providing food for all, giving shelter to the wild animals, and having nesting places in its branches for the birds— 22 Your Majesty, you are that tree! You have become great and strong; your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth.
>
>  23 “Your Majesty saw a holy one, a messenger, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump, bound with iron and bronze, in the grass of the field, while its roots remain in the ground. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven; let him live with the wild animals, until seven times pass by for him.’
>  
>  24 “This is the interpretation, Your Majesty, and this is the decree the Most High has issued against my lord the king: 25 You will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals; you will eat grass like the ox and be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the Most High is sovereign over all kingdoms on earth and gives them to anyone he wishes. 26 The command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that Heaven rules. 27 Therefore, Your Majesty, be pleased to accept my advice: Renounce your sins by doing what is right, and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed. It may be that then your prosperity will continue.” [1^]





And it came to pass.




Nebuchadnezzar was humbled and glorified God directly through Daniel's steadfast faith. It not only shook Nebuchadnezzar, but it shook the whole line of kings ruling Babylon afteward. Cyrus, Nebuchadnezzar's successor, took reign and decreed in the year of Daniel's death the temple of the Israel should be rebuilt in Jerusalem. This set the course for Ezra to rebuild the temple, Nehemiah to rebuild the walls, and the Israelites to move back to their homeland.




How? Influence.




Daniel influenced the path of nations over centuries because he had influence with the King of Babylon. Influence is the level to which your thoughts on a matter are considered in making a decision. It is based upon trust. Trust is built upon meeting the needs of others. How do you meet needs? Serve in love. Daniel exemplified all of these excellently. [2^]




Additionally, we are called to be a people of influence as Christians. It's in our blood to serve and love. But there's a purpose involved: to bring the Kingdom of God until Earth looks like Heaven. And we do so by loving all people, creating a space for people to encounter Jesus, and influencing the "kings" of our cities, neighborhoods, businesses, and organizations.




Do you want to see change? Answer these questions:






  * What do I want to see changed?


  * Who is in authority over it?


  * How can I serve them? How can I help their cause?




It all starts with service. Service requires you can't be in it for your agenda. People will smell that on you a mile away. It seems paradoxical, but it's true. However, genuinely serving in love will open a multitude of doors.




People will protect what they value, but they won't value what you have to say unless you gain influence through trust built in service. As John Maxwell puts it, "People don't care what you have to say unless they know you care." [3^]




This may even require a character transformation in your own life. That's okay. Do it. Keep going. Three things you can do today to start serving and honoring those around you are:






  1. **Be curious** - People want to be known. Learn to ask great questions and focus on learning about others. Approach relationships with the mentality that everyone around you is more interesting than yourself. [4^]


  2. **Be a fan** - There's nothing more encouraging to others than for someone to be a fan of their dream and vision. Ask them about it, then ask, "How can I help you get there?" Who knows, you may have the key to the next step in getting there.


  3. **Steward well** - Actions truly speak louder than words or intentions. Learn to carry yourself with integrity and honor. Be a person of your word. Learn to love others well. Keep your love on! [5^]




I'm going to change the world. So are you. It all starts with influence. So go. Now. Start serving and influencing those around you. That's real leadership.
