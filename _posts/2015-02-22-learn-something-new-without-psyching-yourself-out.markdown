title: Learn Something New Without Psyching Yourself Out

---






There's a teaching model in medicine called _see one, do one, teach one_. It is a form of apprenticeship used to teach new procedures to surgeons. While learning a new procedure, a surgeon will:







  * **see the procedure** once so he/she knows how it's done in practice,


  * **do the procedure** once to demonstrate understanding of the procedure


  * and, finally, **teach the procedure** to reinforce his/her knowledge.





This method exposes a professional to an idea and quickly moves it from passive knowledge to active. This also leaves little room for overthinking the procedure resulting from too much knowledge, removing a common source of fear, anxiety, and, ultimately, error or injury while performing it.





I like to think the _see one, do one, teach one_ model applies to anything else we learn, yet many of us, myself included, don't use it. Instead, my approach usually looks like this:







  * Research the task at hand,


  * Start doing it, but get scared, and stop,


  * Research some more, and more, and more,


  * Rush at the task again until I don't know what to do,


  * Then, finally, give up because I have so much knowledge stored up and no idea where to take it.





I'm learning to break this cyle of psyching myself out of success and into failure.





**The solution is simple: stop consuming, and start producing.**





Who cares if you don't know enough. You will learn along the way. In fact, you will never know everything there is to know about a subject before you start, so there's no point in trying.





Instead of preparing for possible failures for lack of knowledge, prepare for success by acting. Failure will happen. **You determine whether it is a setback or an opportunity for growth.**





Don't psych yourself out before you start. **Define and learn what's needed to begin, start moving, and teach someone else along the way.**





The journey of learning is satisfying when you turn the power of knowledge and understanding into working action.
