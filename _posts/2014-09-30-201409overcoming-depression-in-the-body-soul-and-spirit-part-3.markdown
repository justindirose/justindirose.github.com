title: 'Overcoming Depression in the Body, Soul, and Spirit: The Soul'
---

_This is part three of our five part series on depression._





The further we venture into the composition of humanity, the farther we seemingly get away from science and reason. The soul, one step deeper into the holistic realm of our existence, is still not understood by the scientific community. Even so, scientists, psychologists, and sociologists have mapped out many functions of our souls which can help our understanding of the functions of life.





A common definition of the soul is the part of our being comprised of our mind, will, and emotions. It’s the seat of our physical consciousness. I like to think if the body is where interaction takes place, then the soul is where relationship takes place.





Depression rooted in the soul, I believe, stems from relational issues. From here, depression affects the body in some of the symptoms we listed last week.





I want to open up a discourse on how depression is in part a relational disorder. From my perspective of understanding (now, keep in mind I’m not a psychologist, but this is merely an area of passion and an opinion of mine), our relational interaction is largely governed by a set of mindsets we have about the world. We often learn these from our parents, peers, teachers, etc.





Positive interactions early in life teach us people are trustworthy; negative interactions teach us people are not. Psychologists call this the Trust Cycle: the communication of needs met with either need-meeting or need-avoiding responses creates a bond of trust or no trust. (Find out more about it in Danny Silk’s book [Keep Your Love On](http://www.lovingonpurpose.com/keep-your-love-on/))





These interactions, even single events if not recognized and mended, can result in mindsets built up, forming either positive or negative beliefs. These mindsets govern our interactions with the world around us.





I think we live in a society believing it has been orphaned. I don't necessarily mean the growing up without parents kind of orphan. Instead, I mean many people grew up being taught they are all alone because their parents, though they may try really hard, didn't understand how to show them they are loved and are truly sons and daughters.





This absence of positive relationship with fathers and mothers in our lives causes problems often contributing to depression. Depression is often the result of not knowing how to cope with pain and suffering we often find in life.





When fathers don’t step into fatherly roles, kids grow up aimless and attempting to figure out who they are from their peers.





When mothers don’t act as mothers, kids end up seeking nourishment from unhealthy sources.





I'm not trying to say parents do a bad job. In fact, most parents do a great job of raising their kids. Sometimes it's the perception of unresolved pain that causes problems. Other times, it's flat out bad stuff that happens, like the loss of a loved one, a car accident, or other traumatic events, which wound our souls and can send us eventually spiraling into a depression.





What's most important to note in all of this is there is healing. Whatever the cause of pain, it doesn't matter what, there is healing in Jesus, in friendships, and in reconciliation.





My soul was shattered in a way that only Jesus could bring healing. He broke through the darkness and made me whole. My life changed. Depression left. And in the process, I learned a toolset on how to deal with wounds to the soul. Soul wounds are real, and we have to take them seriously.
I know this list won't be perfect or comprehensive, but these are some tools I've learned will help get out of depression in the soul.







  1. **Involve Jesus** - the King of all Kings knows us better than any other. Putting ourselves before him and letting Him speak and wash over us in His love is more healing and freeing than anything in this world. He's always there, and we are never alone.


  2. **Involve friends** - I heard someone say God gets us 80% of the way healed, and then gives us friends. It's in deep, intimate relationships where God often moves to heal our pain and work out our character. We also find here people truly do care and love us if we let them.


  3. **Learn to recognize and feel feelings** - one of the most instrumental, practical tools I learned is how to put words to feelings and share it with others. If you are feeling alone, learn to say "I'm feeling alone." Or whatever your current emotional state is, like, "I'm feeling ecstatic!" Learning to communicate our feelings helps us to move away from acting out on them.


  4. **Learn to recognize and get needs met healthily**- another super key tool is learning how to say what you need and let other people respond without getting manipulative. So, say what you need, and don't pressure someone else to meet it because it just won't satisfy you. Instead, put it out there, and let someone respond. If they don't, forgive them, and turn to God for your provision. He will help you. Always.


  5. **Learn how to forgive** - I will be talking more about this next week, but forgivness is also huge. Being able to let go of judgment toward people who have hurt you not only frees you to receive love, but frees your soul from prison. Forgiveness is more for us than it is for them.


  6. **Learn how to repent** - If beliefs are what guide our mindsets, repentance is the tool that allows us to change our beliefs. It's simply the act of discovering God's truth, spoken from Him, renouncing what we've previously believed, and asking Him what he desires to give us in return. We declare His truth over our lives until it becomes our reality. That's all it is!


  7. **Seek deeper healing with help (Sozo, counseling)**- I never advocate for anyone to go through depression alone. The above six steps were essential in helping me get free, but it wasn't without the help of trained individuals to help me sort out the deepest of deep issues keeping me away from freedom. If you need help, seek out a local [Sozo ministry](http://bethelsozo.com/) and a counselor. They will be able to help you sort through pain, teach you how to communicate your emotions and feelings, and help you find a support structure to lean on when the going gets rough. It's really important.





Dealing with mindsets is a big issue, but is only part of dealing with the soul. I have more to write on this topic, and we are going to talk about it next week. In that post, we will be discussing forgivness and how letting go of past hurt and pain will set you free.
