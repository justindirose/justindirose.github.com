title: How to Deal with Haters and Receive Real Critique
---





It happens every single time. I hear about haters almost every day, but until recently, I hadn't experienced it. For the first time, someone who doesn't even know me came out of nowhere criticizing a post I made with how they thought it should be done. The words stirred up a lot of emotions in me. You could say I was a bit angry. I made a few comments regarding why I said what I did, and then I left the room.





Frankly, you don't have to give people like that space.





The event reminded me of a tweet [Kyle Adams](http://www.kyleadams.me/), an icon designer and fellow member of the [seanwes community](http://seanwes.com/community), recently posted. He said,






> There's a big difference between critique and hate. Critique requires reasoning and purposed solutions. Hate should simply be ignored.

Kyle, you couldn't be more right.





## Critique vs. Hate





Of the two, _hate_ is a destructive force. Like the occurrence I experienced, hate automatically puts you on the defensive, coming out of left field without any prior information and blasting you with what is incorrect or wrong about your idea or product.





Hate left unchecked and unfiltered will mess you up. It will leave you feeling discouraged, thinking you're not capable, and even wanting to quit. Let's face it, it hurts because the hater has absolutely no regard for you or your work; in other words, **haters only care about themselves.**





Contrary to hate, _critique_ gives life. It takes a weakness and turns it into inspiration, motivation, and assistance. Critique helps you get unstuck and get started on moving forward. Instead of tearing down your work, critique notices your strengths and weaknesses and suggests improvements to take your work to the next level.





**Critiquers care about the person behind the product.** Since your work represents who you are, it's important for a person you allow to affect the direction of your work, and even your life, to be personally invested in it as well.





### Critiques are Built on Trust





You leave your unique mark on everything you create, like a fingerprint on a glass or a footprint in the snow. It's no wonder dismissive or negative commentary on our work is hurtful. In a way, the hater isn't pointing out flaws in our work, but rather, the hater hashes out a distaste of us, our skills, our knowledge, or our style.





However, **the critiquer recognizes the tie between us and our work, seeing one affects the other.** Usually the critiquer understands because he or she is an artist as well. From this place of understanding, the critiquer becomes personally invested, and when he or she sees your work, _you_ are seen.





The best critiques are from trusted people.  You have a responsibility to protect your heart from people who don't care about it. Since your work is a representation of who you are, the only people who should be allowed to speak deeply into it are those who have proven their trustworthiness and investment.





Trust is built upon repeated actions demonstrating value, care, and respect. **If you want someone to hear your voice, build trust, plain and simple.**  Stated differently, if you respect me and my work, listening to you becomes a whole lot easier.





### Evaluate Feedback for Trustworthiness





So, say you just received some feedback. What do you do with it?





Take time to evaluate it. Usually, haters stand out like a tree in the middle of a field. They're _obvious_. But in case you aren't sure what to do with the feedback, ask yourself:







  * Who is this person? Are they some random person from the Internet, or have I seen them around?


  * Does what they say seem genuine? Or is it brash and lacking understanding?


  * Has this person shown any investment into me, my brand, or my cause?


  * Does what they say have merit? Can I make any legitimate changes from this?





Make the judgment if their feedback is worth listening to or not. You are not obligated to listen to everyone who talks to you. You have a finite amount of attention and time, so don't waste your time with people who have no value for you. Once you make that determination, sorting through the feedback and applying it gets a lot easier.





As the saying goes, haters gonna hate. There will always be haters, but there will always be those who are genuinely invested in our success, too. Make the choice to listen to the right voices and ignore the wrong ones.
