title: '#RealMenAre: Six Lies Men Believe About Men'

---

Last time, I began writing about how culture needs to change around men and women in order to overcome the oppression of women in our culture. We addressed some common lies I've seen believed about women.





Now it's time to take a look at what it takes to be a man. I think there are elements of our culture that lend to a twisted perspective of manliness that must be unwrought in order that we might know what a real man looks like.





So here are five lies I've seen men believe about men:





### 1. Men can make it on their own.





This lie has killed the most men and driven them either insane or toward very destructive behaviors. It's the lie that says you can and have to live life by yourself. It says, "I am an island." Problem is, Garfunkel, your heart becomes as hard as stone in this place. Instead of dealing with pain, you stuff it or explode from it. This mindset kills men.





**THE TRUTH:** Men need healthy relationships with other men and women to live healthy, thriving lives as men.





### 2. Men are driven by sexuality.





I'm sure you've heard and even thought of the sentiment that all men are horny and are driven by sex. I mean, it can be pretty believable when we hear it can be difficult for women to go shopping, walk their dog, or even work without getting some sort of sexual comment or look by someone. Yet it's simply not true. Most often, this broken sexual display often comes from a place of undealt-with pain.





**THE TRUTH:** Men can be guided by their appetites or their values. The choice is up to them.





### 3. Men must be having sex or in a relationship to be a man.





It almost seems to be a right of passage to manhood teenagers place on one another. If you haven't had sex, you're not a man. This further entrenches the belief that manhood is something to be held over women, that women are something to conquer instead of cherish and protect.





**THE TRUTH:** Manhood isn't about having a penis and using it; it is about having a heart and loving from it. It takes a father for young men to learn this.





### 4. Men have to be in control.





Paired with the lie that women aren't powerful, this is a destructive force waiting to happen. It's the birthing grounds of co-dependent relationship, where one must give and the other takes so that both feel "fulfilled". But relationship exists for both men and women to feel and be empowered and loved.





**THE TRUTH:** Men use their strength to lift others up and empower them, not to stifle them.





### 5. Men can't be afraid or hurt, otherwise they're not manly.





Like #1, this lie communicates emotion is bad. Men haven't exactly been the best at displaying emotion or care toward others. Watch American commercials and you'll see just that -- bumbling, idiotic men who don't quite get it and don't really quite care about their wives or kids. They'd rather drink beer. But beer, sports, and ignorance will never quite drown out the pain inside. No, they will never satisfy.





**THE TRUTH:** Men can't truly live without processing pain, and that takes recognizing emotion and, yes, crying. These things are okay!





### 6. Pleasure and power can be acquired/purchased for men's benefit.





Ever heard of prostitution? Pornography? Raunchy movies and books? They're all based off the idea that pleasure can be purchased. It's a an issue of feeling unloved and powerless, so men try to substitute it with something that "feels good" and can be controlled. True love cannot be controlled, and trying to falsify it only results in burying the pain that causes men feel unloved and powerless in the first place.





**THE TRUTH:** Pleasure, influence, and love are cultivated in building relational intimacy within the context of marriage, accountable relationships with other men, and healthy community.





We have to start understanding, as men, what it really looks like to be a man. I believe a key component to end domestic violence, orphanhood, divorce, and a myriad of other societal issues is knowing what a true man looks like. This post is only the start of the transformation.
