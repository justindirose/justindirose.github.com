title: '5 Core Values of a Man: #1 - Servanthood'

---





A long time ago, before I was dating my wife (actually, before I even asked her out for the first time), I was troubled about liking her, wondering if it was even okay. So I asked the Lord. I'm certain He responded when I saw a picture in my mind of a young Asian couple in a kitchen. The young woman was making some food and accidentally spilled what she was mixing all over the floor. In response, the young man ran over to her with the glowingest, lovingest eyes I've ever seen, and assisted her in cleaning up the mess, all while he and she looked right at each other in a daze of self-sacrifice and love.
The Lord was trying to teach me a core value of love is servanthood. This little nugget is something I've tried to keep in my heart since that day.




I fully believe if servanthood is a core value of love, servanthood is a key pillar in the idea of being a man. If love is the foundation of a healthy marriage, love must be the key motivator for both parties, man and woman.




I decided to take a look at some reputable sources and what they say about servanthood.




The [Oxford English Dictionary](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/service?q=service) defines service as, "The action of helping or doing work for someone."




Jesus says about servanthood in Matthew 20:26-28, "26 But among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant, 27 and whoever wants to be first among you must become your slave. 28 For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many.” [^1]




In all instances, servanthood involves a help, a sacrifice, a laying down of one's own agenda in favoring of another's.




Service drives our society. Everywhere you go, from the movie theatre to the gas station, your workplace to the computer repair shop, we now expect "customer" service. Most of us expect at least average service, too. But this kind of service is contractual, a "you do this for me, I do this for you" kind of act. You fix my car, I'll pay you money. You keep my water cup full as I eat, I give you a good tip. You plow my driveway in the winter, I'll mow your yard in the summer. This for that. Though that might be service, I want to delineate this is not servanthood.




Servanthood is based on covenental relationship. It says, "I love you so much that I would lay down my life to die for you if it meant you ended up in a better place." It is not self-seeking, nor does it expect anything in return. Not only is this the call of love, this is the call of a man.




How does a man live a life of servanthood? I think he must recognize who he is, whose he is, and what he's been given to steward.




1) Who He Is: In order to live life to the fullest in manhood, a man needs to know a few things about himself. He needs to know his identity in God and what he is made to do. The first we can find in the Bible and through relationship with God and other godly men. The second we find through discovery, the process of trial and error, or as [Jon Acuff](http://acuff.me) puts it in his book, [Start](http://www.amazon.com/Start-Punch-Escape-Average-Matters/dp/1937077594), the process editing our life down to what we enjoy and have been gifted with.




2) Whose He Is: [Bill Johnson](http://bjm.org), pastor of Bethel Church, likes to say its just as important to know Whose you are along with who you are. Knowing God's promises and faithfulness over your life and His desire to follow through with them will empower one to be come a man of servanthood, realizing that he doesn't have to be afraid of anything anymore because your God has everything in control. This not only takes recognition of God, but faith believing that He is who He says He is.




3) What He's Been Given To Steward: All people have been given relationships, gifts, tasks, and strengths to steward. These things are meant not to be used for our gain, but invested into and released for the benefit of others. A man must discover these gifts and put them to use in service of others for their benefit as they lead and live life. We are called to lift up people and create an environment where they are protected and empowered. But most importantly, the greatest thing we've been given to steward is relationship: the connections we have to God and others.[^2]




I've been on a long journey of self-discovery of these things. God is good and he's been doing it in his timing. Every step I take I learn something new, whether it's easy or hard, painful or joyful. The challenge is remembering the process of becoming a man is one of a lifelong journey where the Lord teaches and disciplines us in the path to being conformed to the likeness of Christ, because He was the ultimate man, able to show us the way to be like Him.




A man's life is to be lived for the benefit of others. He's to lay himself down so much that everyone who comes near him is lifted up. I remember the image the Lord showed me from time to time. There are days where my heart is focused only on my wife and doing everything to assist her. Others are spent afraid, trying to guard what's mine and keep from getting hurt. The only way I'm going to learn how to serve, however, is to keep trying. That's why it's a value: it's something you never cease to keep chasing, even though you might not've perfectly attained it, if even so failed abysmally at times.




I challenge you men out there in this heart of servanthood. It is not something you do, but who you are. We are all learning in the journey, but at all costs, together we must learn never to hold back the love which we've been given. It brings life to all who are around us. If you've been holding back from fear, today is the day to stop listening to that voice and run after your identity. Love with wreckless abandon just as God loves you.
