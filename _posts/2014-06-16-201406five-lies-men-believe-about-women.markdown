title: '#RealMenAre: Five Lies Men Believe About Women'
---

There was a recent shooting involving a broken young man I don't think deserves any attention here.





What I think deserves attention is the outcry against sexism and oppression. Women are crying out to be honored, respected, empowered, and, most of all, protected by the men around them. It's not just something women deserve; it's something everyone needs to thrive.





You might be sickened hearing just how bad things are. You just might be wondering how to _change things_. There is a way. But, my fellow men, _you_ have to change. Yes, you.





It's not just enough to be an activist, to make the world aware of the problem. You have to become change.





Most importantly, I believe you have to change what you believe before you can change what you think _before you can change how you act_.
You can't expect change to happen when you think about life the same way you did before. Just like you can't expect to solve a problem by doing the same thing over and over again. (I think Einstein called that insanity.)
One of the biggest ways we can change the way we think is to root out the lies we believe. Today, I'm posting five lies I've seen men believe about women.





### Five Lies Men Believe About Women





#### 1. Women are sexual objects.





I must say this is one of the biggest lies in the world, and it's a subtle one. Women and men both have sexual desires, but _neither_ men nor women are meant to be defined by that desire. This lie is a perversion of what women really do exemplify: beauty. Women show the world some of the most beauty, yet this lie teaches us we can't experience this beauty without sexualizing it.





**THE TRUTH:** Women are examples of beauty and love, which is to be experienced respectfully through healthy relationship.





#### 2. Women are meant to satify my needs.





Satisfaction never comes from putting an expectation on someone else to fulfill your needs. This is where we need to learn to recognize that people may meet some needs through healthy relationship, but can never be the source of all things.





**THE TRUTH:** Women (and men, alike) can meet needs in the context of healthy, respectful, loving relationship, but the source is always God.





#### 3. Women aren't powerful.





A lot of the world likes to say that women aren't capable to do things men can do. If I have one example of the opposite in my life, it's my wife. She's the most capable, brilliant, thoughtful, determined woman I know. And she's going to see her dreams accomplished. And though not all women may be as physically strong as men, all women are capable of tapping into the deepest place of power: power over one's self.





**THE TRUTH:** Phsyical attributes never define one's power; power resides in the resilience and strength of the heart, which women are just as capable to reveal as men.





#### 4. Women are to blame for men's transgressions.





This is a lie as old as time itself when Adam blamed Eve for taking a bite of the forbidden fruit. Many like to ascribe the blame of rape on what women were wearing, or that women tempt men by just revealing their hair. I hate to break it to you, world, but each person is accountable to his or her own actions. Adam still ate the fruit when he could've chosen not to do so. A man can choose to respect a woman versus rape her even if she was standing in front of him completely naked. That's what makes him accountable.





**THE TRUTH:** Women and men alike are accountable for their own actions and managing their own heart and belief.





#### 5. Women are to serve men.





Have you ever heard a joke about a woman belonging in the kitchen or in the bedroom? Does it make you angry or make you laugh? It makes me cringe. Why? Because women are never to be limited and held back by men. My wife and I regularly share the kitchen duties because we work as a team. It's not some chauvanistic life we life where I'm the only one in control and she has to do what I want her to do. In truth, my wife would kick my butt if I were like that. And I would never want her to feel under my thumb! Service is always meant to lift someone else up. So the higher calling is to serve one another to lift each up!





**THE TRUTH:** Women and men alike are called to serve one another out of mutual love and respect, not slave-driven control. Headship is designed to empower, not to lord over.





We have to start uprooting these cultural lies in order to start seeing women for who they are: people deserving of love, respect, empowering, and a chance to make their lives as amazing as they want them to be!
