title: The Creative Tension
---

Being creative can be one of the most rewarding and frustrating things. Everything seems stuck in the middle of the reality of the now and the dream of the not yet. And there we are, sitting in the middle of this crazy tension.
Tension is one of those guaranteed things in life. It holds the universe together. Planets orbiting around the sun are held in the tension of gravity and their own momentum. It's quite incredible. Of course, if the universe faces tension every moment, why wouldn't we face tension in who we are made to be?




You see, we are inherently creative. Our Maker is creative, and He made us that way in His image. It is our identity to be creative, and if its our identity, I believe every one of us has a destiny somehow tied to creativity.




This creative tension can be scary. Down right scary at times. But it gives us the opportunity to play along with or run away from the very destiny itching and scratching to get out from inside of us.




I want you to take a moment to identify a place of tension in your life. Are you pressing in further or running away from it? If you're running away, ask yourself, "Why am I feeling afraid?" Then write that fear down, and write down the truth next to it. Repeat if necessary.




Your life in tension is the key to your destiny. Embrace it!
