_This is our first post in a five post series on depression._





It walks like a ghost among us, sometimes never noticed until it is too late. It might be seen by those it does not chase, but to those it does, it can be an invisible straight jacket.





I’m talking about depression. It’s a big topic, one that affects a large portion of the world today. Many fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters live under depression’s heavy cloud of despair with an estimated [6.9% of all adults in the United States](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/statistics/1mdd_adult.shtml) stuck in it’s jaws.
It’s an often tragic disorder. Many individuals, including creatives, wrestle with the deep blue sea of depression. For some, like Robin Williams, it costs them their lives.





I was also one of them, and it almost cost me mine.





### The Story of My Life…





I struggled throughout my younger years socially. I was really awkward and didn’t have many friends. It didn’t help that soul-shattering events happened early in my life which chained me up inside, preventing me from truly living. I lived my life distantly as a loner, even though I was a quiet, smart, respectful student. I was even an award-winning debater in high school.





I played video games to supplement my lack of relationship. My online community gave me “hope” of friendship, even though many of the people I played with were not very healthy, neither relationally nor in their view of the world. I played very violent video games, and was so addicted I spent hours every night after school and every day during the summer playing. I truly wanted to win and be the best, but I also wanted connection with people that I wasn’t getting from “real life” friends.





I carried this behavior into my college years, finding myself making a huge mess in my loneliness and despair. By my sophomore year, I was so troubled and tormented inside by my pain, I walked around in severe depression. I wanted to hurt myself to try to cope because nothing else was working. There were a handful of occasions I was tempted to cut myself, but I didn’t. Each time there was a voice in my head saying, “Don’t do that Justin.” I listened.





I sought out help through counseling and antidepressants. Counseling didn’t do me much good because I didn’t know how to take ownership over my life. The drugs just made me angry. I never was an angry person before, but I think the anger and hurt I blocked up inside from my earlier life was coming out. It scared me when my anger began to turn into actions. As a result, I decided to get off them.





From then on, the cloud slightly started to lift, but the messes I was still making kept pulling me down into its jaws.





### A Door Opened in Heaven





The only thing that blew it wide open was an encounter with God. There is nothing that the everlasting One, the God of all the universe, cannot overcome in you. He reached down, touched me one night, and delivered me from depression. I felt like a new man, and I really was because I was born again!





We, the church, talk about being born again as a doctrine. Whether or not you believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit, I will tell you one thing: you will know if you’ve had a transformational encounter with the Living God. You’ll never be the same.





The story didn’t end there; it’s still being written. Every day since that moment, that inciting event, has taken me on a deeper journey of what it means to be healthy, pure, holy, righteous, faithful, loving, and clean. Though I didn’t feel the grips of depression after that night, the following years were filled with messy mistakes, confronting conversations, and painful nights filled with tears but also encountering the overwhelming love of God, His deep inner healing, and an incredible journey of freedom which made me whole inside.





Overcoming depression was not an easy road. The love and favor of the Lord made it easier, but it didn’t absolve me from having to take ownership over my life, learn new mindsets, right wrongs, and forgive people. Beating depression is supremely about having victory in Jesus, but it’s also about pressing into becoming a whole person.





### Overcoming Depression Involves Holistic Healing





I believe each person has three parts. Much like God has three parts in Father, Son and Holy Spirit, we have a body, a soul, and a spirit. Holistic living, from the Christian perspective, thus involves getting healing for all three parts.





Depression is a sign something is hurting somewhere inside, but determining whether it’s rooted in the body, soul, or spirit is a work that must be done in partnership with the Holy Spirit. Only He can reveal what you need to overcome.





Over the next few weeks, I will be discussing how I’ve learned to overcome depression in each realm of our being. _It is possible to live free of depression._ I want to take a piece of my life and put it out there, hoping you to find in it an encouragement, an understanding, an empowerment, and a signpost pointing to freedom in Christ.





Creatives, I am especially talking to you. We’re so much more in tune with feelings, beauty, and even the spiritual atmosphere that our creativity often gets twisted through the lens of negative feelings and depression, producing hopeless, dark, and depressing work.





I do not believe our call as creators to be one of creating out of the junk of our lives and leaving the resolution of our creative work to hopeless ruin. Everything is in process, and some of our painful art may be really depressing and hopeless, but what matters is we’re pressing on toward the goal of being hope-releasers. We are influencers and we have a responsibility to show people hope, joy, and reveal something to which we can look forward!





This week, I leave you with an assignment: set 15-20 minutes aside and go to a quiet space. Invite the Holy Spirit to come. Ask Him to pour out His love on you. If you don’t believe in Jesus, that’s okay. Ask Him anyway. He will meet with you whether or not you believe in Him just because He loves you. If you sense/hear/see/think anything positive in this time, write it down! He’s speaking His love over you.





Next week we will discuss how to overcome depression in the physical realm, your body.
