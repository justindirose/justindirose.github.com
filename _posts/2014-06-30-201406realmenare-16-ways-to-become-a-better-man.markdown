In our last two discussions, we've been addressing the lies men believe about women and men. It's important to address the part of the problem being men who don't really know how to be men.





We're only really starting the conversation here. Knowing lies and uprooting them is only part of the solution. Learning how to live a different lifestyle is wholly another ballgame. But I think here we find the meat-and-potatoes of how to change culture.





To be honest, cultural change doesn't just come by making people aware of what's wrong. Just standing up and saying "YEAH I AGREE!" isn't enough. You have to take action. In this case, you must get healthy yourself in order to see the world around you get healthy.





This post, we're focusing on how to get healthy. Want help? Below are some steps you can take to keep pushing down this path.







  1. **Stop looking at porn and chasing after women.** Your fulfillment is not found here. In fact, by going after this stuff, you're chasing after something to silence the pain inside. This isn't going to do the trick. I promise you.


  2. **Know your place spiritually.** This is the only spot I'm going to get preachy. Jesus died so you can be free, healthy, and whole. Most of the items in this list won't be sustainable or even attainable fully unless you seek His freedom. He loves and gives it freely. You don't have to earn it!


  3. **Start seeking healing for your soul.** The only way you're going to take care of someone else is if you can take care of yourself. The hurt from your past, whether it be from parents or friends, relationships or loneliness, has to be dealt with and forgiven to move forward. This is where you'll start to see the biggest impact in your life.


  4. **Learn to be emotional.** If there's one thing I can recommend, learn how to feel your feelings, grieve pain, and move through it toward healing. Learn to cry. It is a lie to say a man can't cry. It's one of the most powerful things a man can do, second only to...


  5. **Learn to show love.** We live in such a hands-off, closed-up world, many of us don't really know what it's like to receive real love. Sexual issues are a relational disorder usually rooted in not knowing what non-sexual love is like combined with some sort of hurt. Gary Chapman's book The 5 Love Languages is an excellent resource to know what healthy love looks like.


  6. **Give respect in order to receive respect.** Remember, you are entitled to nothing. You are responsible for teaching people how to treat you. That means how you treat you and others sets the standard for how they treat you back.


  7. **Start hanging around with better people.** It's no help to try to get healthy if you regularly expose yourself to people who act how you don't want to act anymore.


  8. **Don't be a loner.** If you don't have friends, make some. You have to be a friend to get a friend. You will learn how to love people better, including women, by learning to be a friend.


  9. **Learn to listen.** If there's one skill that will assist you relationally in life, it's learning to listen and share back what you heard and engage the other person in that place.


  10. **Speak up.** Say wonderful things to people without expecting anything in return. Be the most encouraging person in the room.


  11. **Value honoring confrontation.** You don't have to put up with people tearing you down, but if someone tells you something's wrong, humble yourself and listen. Secondly, don't be afraid to do the same for someone else.


  12. **Recognize your fears.** Nothing can hold back a man more than not recognizing of what he's afraid. Take a stand against them and push through. Be adventurous!


  13. **Stop watching/playing sex and violence-driven movies, TV shows, and videogames.** If you're trying to make a difference, take a stand against media that _degrades_ women and human life in general. What you watch will ultimately influence your heart and your belief.


  14. **Reject the notion that to be a man is to be macho.** There is no manliness in sheer demonstrations of strength, power, and arrogance. Manliness is found in strength shown through service and love of others.


  15. **Don't be a whimp either.** Emasculating and degrading yourself in return will also get you nowhere. Men and women are meant to live together as partners/co-laborers with equal authority to make this world a better place.


  16. **Learn to respect "No."** Boundaries define where you end and I begin. If someone tells you, "No," respect the request and back off. Likewise, learn to say no to other people. Boundaries by Cloud and Townsend is the best resource out there on this topic.


  17. **Find a mentor.** If there's one person who can help you grow in your journey toward health, it's a man who has been there before. Find, build relationship with, and meet with him regularly, pouring out your heart seeking his wisdom. It will be a well from which you can draw to do the same for someone else. That's what real transformation looks like.





Changing the world starts with changing yourself. If you want to see your city changed, _be an example_. If you want to change how people see women around you, start treating them differently than everyone else and _stand for it_! People need to see the way often before they will walk in it.





There are lots of great resources out there on this topic. Some of them are mentioned in this post. Another resouce is Mark Peterson's [Purity Pursuit](http://puritypursuit.com) blog. Peruse it for lots more helpful information on getting healthy.
